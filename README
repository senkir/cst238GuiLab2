This lab is focused on building a clock with multiple views
Discovery:
I will have to make extensive use of the MVC pattern to swap out views and satisfy the requirements of this lab.  A clock consists of a driver for the time, On top of this the form of the clock has many attributes.  The standard seven segment display of a digital clock is repeated four times, once for each digit.  This will have to be implemented as its own class.  In addition, the actual clock controller will have to talk to a controller for the view object.  


Analysis:


Documentation:
Going off of the original UML diagram, I know I need to go into more detail.  For instance, the seven segment display should be broken up into components, with controllers and views for each segment, which are then controlled by the main driver for the clock type.  

Speaking of which, positioning the segments in the digital display is going to be a real pain if i do it programatically.  I'd better try to build them with a nib and IBOutlet controls.  This seems the most efficient way to get this working.  

Views are giving me trouble again.  I seem to not be able to refresh the mainMenu view like I did in the previous lab.  Somewhere along the line i think I'm setting the controllers improperly.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon.  I'm reunning out of time and I really want to at least have the digital clock working.
